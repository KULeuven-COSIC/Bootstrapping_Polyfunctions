HElib is an open-source (<a href="http://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0">Apache License v2.0</a>) 
software library that implements <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homomorphic_encryption">homomorphic encryption</a> (HE).
Currently available schemes are the implementations of the
<a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/277">Brakerski-Gentry-Vaikuntanathan</a>  (BGV) scheme with bootstrapping and the Approximate Number 
scheme of <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2016/421">Cheon-Kim-Kim-Song</a> (CKKS), along with many
optimizations to make homomorphic evaluation runs faster, focusing mostly on
effective use of the <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2011/133">Smart-Vercauteren</a> ciphertext packing techniques and
the <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2012/099">Gentry-Halevi-Smart</a> optimizations.

Please refer to <a href="https://github.com/homenc/HElib/blob/master/CKKS-security.md">CKKS-security.md</a> for the latest discussion on the security of the CKKS scheme implementation in HElib.

Articles that describe some aspects of HElib include:

  - <a href="https://eprint.iacr.org/2020/1481">HElib Design Principles</a>, Shai Halevi and Victor Shoup, November 2020.
  - <a href="http://eprint.iacr.org/2014/106">Algorithms in HElib</a>, Shai Halevi and Victor Shoup, published in <a href="http://www.iacr.org/conferences/crypto2014/">CRYPTO 2014</a>.

Since mid-2018 HElib has been under extensive refactoring for _Reliability_, 
_Robustness & Serviceability_, _Performance_, and most importantly _Usability_ 
for researchers and developers working on HE and its uses.

HElib supports an <b>"assembly language for HE"</b>, providing low-level routines
(set, add, multiply, shift, etc.), sophisticated automatic noise management,
improved BGV bootstrapping, multi-threading, and also support for Ptxt (plaintext) 
objects which mimics the functionality of Ctxt (ciphertext) objects.

HElib is written in C++17 and uses the <a href="http://www.shoup.net/ntl/">NTL</a> mathematical library.
